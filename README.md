# Fitness-Web-App

I have been working with personal trainer Jeremy Genin on this project. I have know Jeremy for some time and have been a fan of his online branding through social media. I approached him in order to see if there was something I could produce for him that would also satisfy my capstone project requirement. He was very receptive to the idea of collaborating and we have began to meet on a regular basis to work on ideas for an app that will be something he could use to aid in his operations and potentially offer growth opportunities for him.
